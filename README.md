# Desafio t√©cnico Front-end Mercado Libre

This guide explains how to use this app powered by:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for the Web
- [React](https://react.dev/) - The library for web and native user interfaces.
- [Storybook](https://react.dev/) - A front-end workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

And just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Useful commands
- `npm run dev` - Run the application in development mode (enabling hot-reload, error reporting and more).
- `npm run build` - Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `npm run start` - Starts the application in production mode (the application should be compiled with next build first).
- `npm run storybook` - Run storybook locally.
- `npm run test` - Run unit test for UI components.
